**Symptoms**: 
- Ear pain
- Referred pain to the side of the head
- Face pain
- Jaw pain

## Exercise Program Overview
- **Frequency**: 6 times per day
- **Duration**: At least 3 weeks
- **Time per session**: 1 minute to complete all exercises
- **Purpose**: Realign the muscles in the TMJ region
- **Important note**: Takes several weeks to realign - don't give up

## Complete Exercise List with Detailed Instructions

### Exercise 1: Tongue-to-Roof Breathing
**Name**: Deep Breathing with Tongue Position
**Description**: Hold tongue to roof of mouth with proper positioning while performing deep breathing
**Instructions**:
1. Place tongue tip just behind the teeth
2. Hold tongue firmly against the roof of the mouth
3. Take six deep breaths while maintaining tongue position
**Timing**:
- Repetitions: 6 deep breaths
- Hold duration: Throughout each breath cycle
- Rest: Natural breathing rhythm between breaths

### Exercise 2: Tongue-Stabilized Jaw Opening
**Name**: Wide Mouth Opening with Tongue Support
**Description**: Open mouth widely while maintaining tongue position to prevent jaw clicking
**Instructions**:
1. Hold tongue to the roof of your mouth
2. Open mouth widely
3. Ensure jaw does not click during movement
4. Close mouth slowly
**Timing**:
- Repetitions: 6 times
- Movement: Slow and controlled
- Rest: Brief pause between repetitions
**Safety Note**: Jaw should not click - this indicates proper alignment

### Exercise 3: Bilateral Jaw Pressure Control
**Name**: Finger-Guided Jaw Alignment
**Description**: Use finger pressure on both sides to guide proper jaw alignment during opening
**Instructions**:
1. Place one finger on each side of jaw
2. Apply equal pressure to both sides
3. Open jaw very slowly while maintaining pressure
4. Do not allow jaw to click
5. If jaw clicks, release and restart more slowly
6. Close jaw with continued pressure guidance
**Timing**:
- Repetitions: 6 times
- Movement: Very slow and controlled
- Hold: Maintain pressure throughout movement
**Safety Note**: Equal pressure ensures correct alignment; clicking indicates need to slow down

### Exercise 4: Chin Resistance Exercise
**Name**: Fist-Resistance Jaw Opening
**Description**: Create resistance with fist under chin while opening jaw
**Instructions**:
1. Make a fist
2. Place fist directly under chin
3. Balance the weight of fist against chin
4. Gently try to open jaw against resistance
5. Avoid allowing jaw to click
6. Hold position
7. Release and return to starting position
**Timing**:
- Hold duration: 6 seconds
- Repetitions: 6 times
- Rest: Brief pause between repetitions
**Safety Note**: Try not to allow jaw to click during exercise

### Exercise 5: Lateral Jaw Resistance (Left and Right)
**Name**: Side Jaw Pressure Exercise
**Description**: Apply steady pressure to side of jaw below the hinge
**Instructions**:
1. Press fist against left side of jaw below the hinge
2. Maintain steady, consistent pressure
3. Hold position
4. Release
5. Repeat on opposite (right) side of jaw
**Timing**:
- Hold duration: 6 seconds per side
- Repetitions: 6 times per side
- Rest: Brief pause between repetitions and sides
**Sequence**: Complete all repetitions on left side, then switch to right side

### Exercise 6: Double Chin Neck Stretch
**Name**: Chin Retraction Exercise
**Description**: Create double chin position to stretch neck muscles
**Instructions**:
1. Place one finger on chin
2. Move chin backward as if making a double chin
3. Feel tightness at the back of neck (this is normal and desired)
4. Hold position
5. Release and return to neutral position
**Timing**:
- Hold duration: 6 seconds
- Repetitions: 6 times
- Rest: Brief pause between repetitions
**Expected sensation**: Tightness at back of neck indicates proper execution

## Exercise Sequence and Flow
1. **Preparation**: Tongue-to-Roof Breathing (Exercise 1)
2. **Mobility**: Tongue-Stabilized Jaw Opening (Exercise 2)
3. **Alignment**: Bilateral Jaw Pressure Control (Exercise 3)
4. **Strengthening**: Chin Resistance Exercise (Exercise 4)
5. **Lateral Strengthening**: Side Jaw Pressure - Left then Right (Exercise 5)
6. **Neck Integration**: Double Chin Neck Stretch (Exercise 6)

## Safety Notes and Precautions
1. **No Clicking**: Jaw should not click during any exercise - this indicates misalignment
2. **Slow Movement**: All movements should be slow and controlled
3. **Equal Pressure**: When using bilateral pressure, ensure equal force on both sides
4. **Consistency**: Must be performed 6 times daily for at least 3 weeks
5. **Patience**: Takes several weeks to realign muscles - don't give up
6. **Professional Guidance**: Exercises prescribed by medical professional
